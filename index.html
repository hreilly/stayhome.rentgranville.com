                <p>More than 90% of apartment searches already start online, so why not make the rest of the process accessible from anywhere? When it comes down to it, it's Granville's job to meet these changing needs.</p>

                <h2>What We're Doing</h2>
                <p><strong>At Granville Realty</strong>, we have always believed in the power of community. We know we must all work together in the face of uncertainty, and there is no higher priority to us than the wellbeing of our tenants and our staff. That's why we're striving to create systems that still provide services to you while protecting one another and minimizing in-person interaction. Wherever possible, our staff are working from home so they can be with their families and we can all do our part to keep each other safe. We hope that you won't hesitate to reach out to us with any question or concerns. Below, you'll find helpful information about how we're handling these temporary changes.</p>

                <p>In order to reduce exposure for our technicians, leasing agents, and your families, <strong>we will be rescheduling and/or delaying some non-emergency repair work orders</strong> until public officials have lifted the recommended social distancing and self-islation guidelines. In addition, the following changes will be in place until recommendations from health and governmental organizations change:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All indoor shared common spaces are closed until further notice (gyms, clubhouses, etc.)</li>
                    <li>In-person community events are cancelled until further notice</li>
                    <li>Outdoor spaces are still open, but we encourage you to practice the 6-foot social distancing rule recommended by the CDC</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We truly appreciate your patience and consideration as we all work together to protect our communities and our loved ones. Our whole team sincerely thanks you for helping us help each other.</p>
