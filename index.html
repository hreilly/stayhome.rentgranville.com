            <p>At GV Realty, we have always believed in the power of community. We know we must all work together in the face of uncertainty, and there is no higher priority to us than the wellbeing of our tenants and our staff. That's why we're striving to create systems that still provide services to you while protecting one another and minimizing in-person interaction. Wherever possible, our staff are working from home so they can be with their families and we can all do our part to keep each other safe. We hope that you won't hesitate to reach out to us with any question or concerns. Below, you'll find helpful information about how we're handling these temporary changes.</p>
